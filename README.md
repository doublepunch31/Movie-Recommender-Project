# Movie Recommender System

## Overview

Welcome to the **Movie Recommender System** project! This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements a movie recommendation engine using data from the [MovieTweetings dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sidooms/MovieTweetings/master/latest/movies.dat)â€”a derivative of the popular MovieLens dataset. The system performs exploratory data analysis, visualization, and basic statistical analysis on movie ratings to understand user behavior and movie popularity.

## Features

- **Dynamic Data Loading:**  
  The project automatically loads movie and ratings data directly from GitHub. No manual data download is required.
  
- **Data Analysis:**  
  - Counts total movies, ratings, and unique users.
  - Analyzes rating distributions and computes average ratings.
  - Identifies the most-watched, highest-rated, and lowest-rated movies.
  
- **Visualization:**  
  Utilizes `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to create visual representations of rating distributions and trends.
  
- **Extensibility:**  
  Serves as a foundation for advanced recommendation systems, including collaborative filtering and content-based approaches.

## Dataset

The project uses the following datasets, which are directly fetched from GitHub:

- **Movies:** [movies.dat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sidooms/MovieTweetings/master/latest/movies.dat)
- **Ratings:** [ratings.dat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sidooms/MovieTweetings/master/latest/ratings.dat)

Both files use `::` as the delimiter. Since the data is loaded directly from GitHub, there's no need for any manual downloads.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab**
- **Python Libraries:**
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
